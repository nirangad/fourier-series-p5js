# Fourier series representation

This is a simple representation of Fourier series using p5.js library.

## Usage

Simply open up `index.html` on any browser.

## Customizations

You can adjust following variables in index.js file to generate different waves.

```
let main_radius = 100;
let dot_radius = 5;
let circles = 20;
```

Increasing the circle count will give you a smooth square wave
